# Shallow water equations
Model solving the 2D [shallow water equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations). The momentum equations are linearized while the continuity equation is solved non-linearly.

As it is set up right now, the model initates with a large gaussian bump resulting in waves propagate away from the bump, then interacts with the walls (no flow condition).
